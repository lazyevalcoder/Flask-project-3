I want to create a python app that gives some top level information about metro cities and population. 

Functions:
The app will have an option for the user to upload a csv file and click on submit button. 
The csv file has two columns City and Population. Once the file is upload by user and clicks on submit, the app will calculate the top 3 cities with highest population, average population and median population and display the output.

Can you think step by step and give the code for this app.
